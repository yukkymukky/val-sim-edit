How to edit Valorant Simulator DB Values (extension way) - yukky
 
The values for the simulator are all stored locally in an IndexedDB which allows us to edit them and play however we want.
 
how to:
 
1. Install: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/idb-crud-indexeddb-manage/olbigpjodejcmmdkafnhaphdblimjogg
 
2. Go to Valorant Simulator and Create a game
 
3. Open up to idb crud extension. If on chrome should be top right under the puzzle icon.
 
4. Click refresh button by IndexedDB. After hitting refresh your DB should appear. Looks like: ValSim-YOURUSER-YOURTEAM-v1-2024...
 
5. Click that the arrow next to the DB

7. Use either the teamID, player name (case sensitive), or any other field to narrow down the player. I am going to edit JohnQt's stats!

8. After you find your player, click the arrow next to the players name and a thing should appear at the bottom. Expand it by clicking the arrow next to the number 0. (note for seasons after 1, you will have to edit the latest value rather than 0, so for season 2, you will edit 1 instead of 0 when it pops up)

Here I made johnqt have 99 stats, 99 potential, 99 growth (development speed), and changed his salary to 0!!!!!!
 
10. After you have edited all that you want, and maybe more, close the menu and refresh the page.
